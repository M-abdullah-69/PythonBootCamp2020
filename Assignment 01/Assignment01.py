# Q3
song = f"""They look for picture perfect
Don't look deeper than the surface
Bubblegum always pops and
Stars they fade out, life never stops
I don't do what Simon says
Get the message 'cause it's read
That's just life it never plays fair
Said to follow any dream
Be a puppet on a string
Works for you but that isn't me
This ain't another pop song 'bout fallin' in love
Or a party song 'bout drinks and drugs
No more singin' songs 'bout breakin' my heart
And my lonely nights, dancin' in the dark
If I'm a guilty pleasure
I want this life forever
I'll take it on 'cause anything is better
Than another pop song 'bout fallin' in love
But if you wanna sing along say, "I don't give a what"
A hamster on the wheel
That's how it's feels tryin' to be real
These unrealistic expectations,â€¦
I don't do what Simon says
Get the message 'cause it's read
That's just life it never plays fair
Said to follow any dream
Be a puppet on a string"""
